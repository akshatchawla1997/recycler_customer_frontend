              We utilize &#34;cookies&#34; to store specific user information and monitor their visits to the Site. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small piece of data sent to the user&apos;s browser and
              stored on their system&apos;s hard drive. Cookies are only sent to the user&apos;s system&apos;s hard drive if they access the site from that particular computer. Unless the user
              deactivates or deletes the cookie, each time they use the same computer to access the Site, our web servers will be alerted to their visit, allowing us to track their visit and usage
              patterns. In general, we use cookies to identify users and to enable the following:
            </p>
            <p className='py-3'>Access user Registration Information or Account Information so that users don&apos;t have to re-enter it.</p>

            <p className='py-3'>
              Users can control whether and how cookies are accepted by configuring their browser settings on the computer they use to access the Site. By adjusting their preferences in the browser,
              users can choose to accept all cookies, receive notifications when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies. If a user opts to reject all cookies by using the cookie-disabling function in
              their browser, they may need to re-enter information on the Sites more frequently, and some features of the Sites may not be available.
